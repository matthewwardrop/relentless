# Relentless

Relentless is a program (written in Python) that is designed to allow rapid
testing and benchmarking of solutions to programming competitions. It is
(optionally) multi-threaded and can generate pretty reports using LaTeX.

For usage, see scripts/relentless; or run `relentless` after installation.

Please note: This software has only been tested on a recent distribution of
Linux. If code changes are required to work on other systems, patches are
welcome.
